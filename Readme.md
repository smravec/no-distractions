**Supported platforms:**
- YouTube → Subscriptions only, no homepage feed or Shorts
- Instagram → Main feed and Reels removed, profile/direct access remains
- Facebook → Main feed and Reels removed, profile/direct access remains
- Reddit → Your subscribed subreddits only

Works on desktop and mobile browsers.
