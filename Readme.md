> Block algorithmic feeds. Keep intentional browsing.

## What it does

No Distractions removes recommendation feeds from social media while keeping the sites functional. Instead of endless scrolling, you see only content you consciously choose to follow.

- <img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/Instagram-E4405F?logo=instagram&logoColor=white" alt="Instagram" height="20"> → Main feed and Reels removed, profile/direct access remains
- <img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/Facebook-1877F2?logo=facebook&logoColor=white" alt="Facebook" height="20"> → Main feed and Reels removed, profile/direct access remains
- <img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/Reddit-FF4500?logo=reddit&logoColor=white" alt="Reddit" height="20"> → Your subscribed subreddits only
